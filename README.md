# StockPrediction_LSTM

📈 **Stock Price Prediction with LSTM** 🚀

In this project, I had the exciting opportunity to dive into the world of stock market analysis and prediction using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The goal was to predict the future stock price of any company of my choice.

## Project Overview

📊 The main objective of this project was to build an LSTM-based model that could analyze historical stock price data and make accurate predictions about its future trends.

## Technologies Used

🔧 For this project, I primarily utilized the following tools and technologies:
- Python for data manipulation, visualization, and model implementation.
- Jupyter Notebook as the coding environment for interactive development.
- Keras library to build and train the LSTM model.

## Approach

📝 The following steps outline the approach I took to complete this project:
1. **Data Collection:** Gathered historical stock price data of the selected company from reliable sources or APIs.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data for input into the LSTM model.
3. **LSTM Model:** Designed and implemented an LSTM-based deep learning model using Keras.
4. **Training:** Trained the model using historical stock price data.
5. **Prediction:** Utilized the trained model to make future stock price predictions.
6. **Evaluation:** Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Key Results

📈 The LSTM model showcased its capabilities in capturing intricate patterns and dependencies in the stock price data. As a result, it made impressive predictions on future stock prices.

## Conclusion

🙌 This project was a fantastic learning experience that enabled me to explore the world of data science, machine learning, and stock market analysis. Building an LSTM model from scratch and witnessing it make accurate predictions was truly rewarding.

🚀 I encourage you to check out the Jupyter Notebook provided in this repository to see the code and dive into the details of the project.
